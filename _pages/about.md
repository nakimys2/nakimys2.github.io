Hey, I'm David Cho!

I am a recent software engineering graduate from Queen's University, Kingston, Canada. Currently, I am job searching, 
as well as working on a project from UC Santa Barbara to combine python, R and C++ to improve the overall efficiency
while maintaining the ease-of-use of by creating a single package which incorporates python and R interfaces to create
C++ bindings for statistical and machine learning module.

My primary languages are Python and Java, and I am currently expanding my territory by learning C++ and R.
